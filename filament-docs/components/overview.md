## #Introduction

Filament packages consume a set of core components that aim to provide a consistent and maintainable foundation for all interfaces. Some of these components are also available for use in your own applications and Filament plugins.

## #Package components

The various packages in the Filament project can be used outside of a panel:
- Action
- Form
- Infolist
- Notifications
- Schema
- Table
- Widget


## #Blade components

Aside from the core packages, all Filament projects can also consume the Blade components that Filament uses internally:
- Avatar
- Badge
- Button
- Breadcrumbs
- Checkbox
- Dropdown
- Empty state
- Fieldset
- Icon button
- Input
- Input wrapper
- Link
